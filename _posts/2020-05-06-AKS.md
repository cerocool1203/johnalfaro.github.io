 ðŸš€Hello there, This is my first post and I hope it helps someone and contructive feedback is always welcomeðŸš€. I have been working on getting an [Azure private Kubernetes Service][private-aks] and one of most important features recently released is Private Endpoint as this will allow us to ensure the API server will be using a private IP address that you managed. Of course, it does come with limitations that you will need to asses based on the project requeriments
<!-- ![image-center](/assets/''){: .align-center} -->
```ruby
provider "azurerm" {
  skip_provider_registration = "true"
  version = "~>2.7"
  features {}
}
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
