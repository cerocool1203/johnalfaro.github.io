## Introduction üöÄ

Cost overruns can derail even the most well-planned cloud strategies. Fortunately, both AWS and Azure offer native capabilities for detecting cost anomalies. In this blog, I'll show how each provider approaches this challenge, highlight their pros and cons, and share how I implemented Terraform configurations to create anomaly detection alerts for both.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ML-based detection adapts over time                                      | Requires initial setup of monitors and subscriptions          |
| High granularity: monitor services, accounts, regions, or tags           | No unit cost attribution by customer or project               |
| Integrates with SNS (Slack, email, Lambda)                               | Still reactive ‚Äì after cost spikes occur                      |

### How it works

AWS uses machine learning models to monitor usage patterns across services, accounts, and tags. It generates alerts via Amazon SNS when anomalies are detected.

### Terraform Example

```hcl
resource "aws_ce_anomaly_monitor" "example" {
  name              = "FinOps Anomaly"
  monitor_type      = "DIMENSIONAL"
  monitor_dimension = "SERVICE"
  tags              = local.tags
}

resource "aws_ce_anomaly_subscription" "example" {
  name      = "FinOps Anomaly Alert"
  frequency = "DAILY"
  monitor_arn_list = [
    aws_ce_anomaly_monitor.example.arn
  ]
  subscriber {
    type    = "EMAIL"
    address = "me@johnalfaro.com"
  }
  threshold_expression {
    dimension {
      key           = "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE"
      match_options = ["GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL"]
      values        = ["100"]
    }
  }
  tags = local.tags
}
```

After a couple of days, you will start receiving emails with alerts like this one:

## üü¶ Azure Cost Anomaly Detection

| <span style="color:green;">‚úîÔ∏è Pros</span>                 | <span style="color:red;">‚ùå Cons</span>                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Native integration with Cost Management                   | Max 5 alert rules per subscription                      |
| Drill-down into resource groups or subscriptions          | 36-hour delay post-usage before detection runs          |
| Uses WaveNet models for forecasting                       | Less flexible than AWS                                  |

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:**  
> Azure anomaly detection is easy to set up and integrates with Cost Management, but alerting and automation options are limited.
{: .notice--info}

### How it works

Azure Cost Anomaly Detection is built on Microsoft's WaveNet forecasting models and analyzes daily cost usage trends against historical data (up to 60 days). It looks for unexpected spikes in costs for a subscription or a resource group by comparing forecasted vs actual usage.

### Terraform Example

More info on setting up Azure Cost Anomaly Detection can be found in the [Azure Terraform Provider documentation][azuretf].

```hcl
resource "azurerm_cost_anomaly_alert" "sub" {
  name               = "finopsanomaly"
  display_name       = "FinOps Anomaly Alert"
  subscription_id    = "/subscriptions/${data.azurerm_subscription.me.subscription_id}"
  email_subject      = "FinOps Alert - ${data.azurerm_subscription.me.display_name}"
  email_addresses    = ["me@johnalfaro.com"]
}
```

After a couple of days, you will start receiving emails with alerts like this one:

## üö¶ What Else Can You Do With the Alerts?

### üüß AWS

AWS Cost Anomaly Detection integrates natively with Amazon SNS, unlocking powerful automation and downstream workflows:

- **Trigger Lambda functions:** Automate cost mitigation (e.g., resource tagging, notification routing, stopping instances).
- **Integrate with chat tools:** Use AWS Chatbot or webhooks to notify Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Amazon Chime.
- **Store alerts in S3:** Archive structured alerts for audit and trend analysis.
- **Route via EventBridge:** Enable advanced rule-based routing and cross-service workflows.

This allows for fully automated cost guardrails beyond basic email notifications.

### üü¶ Azure

Azure‚Äôs anomaly alerting is more limited, but still offers options:

- **Email notifications:** Default mechanism for anomaly alerts.
- **API polling workaround:** Use Azure Functions or Logic Apps to query anomalies via the CostManagement/anomalyDetectionResults API and act on them.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è At this time, Azure does not support direct integration of anomaly detection with Action Groups.**

## Summary üéØ

AWS offers more flexibility and precision in anomaly detection. Its integration with other AWS services like Lambda, Step Functions, EventBridge, and Chatbot enables more automation and cost guardrails beyond simple notifications, making it a better option for enterprise environments.

Azure, while easy to set up and integrated with Cost Management, is falling behind in practical usability. The lack of direct support for Action Groups, limited alerting mechanisms, and a tendency to produce unnecessary alerts makes the feature less actionable and noisy. As it stands, Azure‚Äôs anomaly detection alerts are not yet ideal for enterprise-grade operations in my opinion.

I hope Microsoft invests in improving this feature to make it more reliable and enterprise-ready‚Äîdefinitely something every FinOps team wants to have, but it‚Äôs not quite there yet.

Let me know what you think‚Äîare you using either provider‚Äôs detection service? Or maybe both? üòÑ
